/*
 * Virtual function call cannot be resolved link-time. So instead the binding between the
 * invocation of a virtual function and the actual implementation must happen at run time
 * which is called late binding(as opposed to the link-time binding, which is also called
 * early binding)
 *
 * Practically all C++ compilers implement late binding by means of one Virtual Table(vtbl) per class
 * and a Virtual Pointer (vptr) per each object. This method can be applied to C as well.
 *
 * Virtual Table is a table of function pointers corresponding to the virtual functions introduced
 * by a class. In C, a Virtual Table can be emulated by a structure to pointer of functions.
 *
 * vptr is declared as pointer to an immutable object (see the const keyword in front of the *),
 * because the Virtual Table should not be changed and is, in fact, allocated in ROM
 *
 * The Virtual Pointer (vptr) is inherited by all subclasses, so the vptr of the shape_t class
 * will be automatically available in all its subclasses, such as rectangle_t and circle_t etc.
